# Input explanation

This folder contains the essential input files required by Sciantix:

- **`input_settings.txt`**: Specifies the models and numerical solvers used in the simulation.
- **`input_history.txt`**: Includes the time (h), temperature (K), fission rate (fiss/m³-s), and hydrostatic stress (MPa) as a function of time.
- **`input_initial_conditions.txt`**: Sets initial conditions for the simulation.
- **`input_scaling_factors.txt`**: (Optional) File for scaling factors.

Below is a detailed description of each file.
