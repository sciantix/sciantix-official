SAMPLE
 - as-stored sample (not oxidised)
 - (10–20 mg) of BWR UO2 with 65 GWd/t taken from a region close to the cladding (irradiated at temperatures below 800 K by [4])
 - described in detail in [3].
 - crystallographic structure of the oxidised fuel matrix was studied in a previous paper [4].
 - The outer surface of UO2 annealed at 1900 K presented well define big grains (5–8 um diameter), with pores present mainly at the grain boundary (picture 5a).

THERMAL ANNEALING
 - heating rate: 30 K/min = 180 K/h 
 - heating temperatures from 300K up to 2800K

NB. The ionisation electron energy was 40 eV, sufficient to ionise all the species released, but too high to avoid dissociation of complex molecules present in the vapour (such as CsOx, CsTe, Cs2MoO4).

RESULTS

Table 1 reports the fraction of fission products released (%) in the temperature range 300–1900 K from UO2 fuel oxidised (column 2) and non-oxidised (column 3).
The fractions are normalised to the total inventory released in the experiment with non-oxidised fuel up to 2700 K, which completely vaporised the sample.
