SAMPLE
 - as-stored sample (not oxidised)
 - (10–20 mg) of BWR UO2 with 65 GWd/t taken from a region close to the cladding (irradiated at temperatures below 800 K)
 - described in detail in [3].
 - crystallographic structure of the oxidised fuel matrix was studied.
 - The outer surface of UO2 annealed at 1900 K presented well define big grains (5–8 um diameter), with pores present mainly at the grain boundary (picture 5a) by the following work of Hiernaut in 2008.
 - It can be seen that the initial grain size of approximately 5 um is maintained up to 2400 K, since formation of large intergranular pores prevents diffusion-driven grain growth.
 - The irradiated fuel samples were small pieces of 1 mm3 volume taken from the periphery of a pellet;
THERMAL ANNEALING
 - stepwise heating up to 2800K, taken from Fig.4.
