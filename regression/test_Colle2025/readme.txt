SAMPLES
 - S1: 67 MWd/kgU; S2 & S3: 55 MWd/kgU
 - irradiation temperature between 1400 K and 1500 K
 - fragment size 100 um, weight few mg
 - within this burnup range the fuel might be slightly hyperstoichiometric
THERMAL ANNEALING
 - release period 10K/min = 600 K/h

RESULTS
 - S1 to S3, I+ and Cs+ peaks were observed in the temperature range of 800 K to 1200 K and can be assigned to grain boundary release. 
   The curves partially matched in shape, which could indicate that they may stem from the same compound. However, no signal for CsI was observed
 - Cs+ and I+ peaks were observed in the 1500 K to 2250 K temperature range and again no CsI+
 - Above 2250 K no ionic Cs+and I-

The mobility of fifission gas bubbles is controlled by the temperature gradient in the fuel pellet and the typical temperature for the start of
fission gas bubble diffusion is between 1200 .C and 1600 .C for (near) stoichiometric UO2 fuel, which is above the typical temperatures occurring in LWR fuel during normal operation. 
This is reflected during laboratory anneals in stage C in Fig. 4.


The absence of CsI in our experiments can have two reasons: 
(i) It was not formed during reactor operation. 
(ii) It was no longer present in the fuel at the moment of the experiments.
Therefore we must take into account the fact that it is highly probable that CsI decomposes in a gamma radiation field.
