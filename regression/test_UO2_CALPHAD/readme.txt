Test to verify the correct coupling between OC and SCIANTIX. 
In particular it concerns the capability of assess the equilibrium phase of U-O system at different temperatures and stoichiometry.
The test is carried out without irradiation conditions, i.e. setting zero fission rate. 
To compare the results with the phase diagram of Gueneau 2002, pressure is set at 1 bar.
