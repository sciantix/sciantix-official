    ! Purpose:
    ! ========
    !
    !> \details The purpose of this subroutine is to check whether a solution phase should be removed from the
    !! system.  A solution phase should be removed from the sytem if the number of moles of that phase is
    !! less than a certain tolernace (specified in InitThermo.f90).    It may be possible that this phase may
    !! not be removed directly from the system because it would result in a singularity.  Provisions are in
    !! place to check if a pure condensed phase should take the place of this solution phase.  If this does not
    !! work, then a check is performed to see if a different solution phase should take the place of this phase.
    !! If this does not work and the number of moles of this solution phase is sufficiently small, then pure
    !! condensed phases are systematically removed from the system in a last attempt to converge.
    !
    !
    ! Pertinent variables:
    ! ====================
    !
    ! nSolnPhases           The number of solution phases in the assemblage.
    ! nSolnPhasesSys        The number of solution phases in the database.
    ! nElements             The number of elements in the system.
    ! lPhasePass            A logical variable indicating whether the new estimated phase assemblage passed
    !                        (.TRUE.) or failed (.FALSE.).
    ! dChemicalPotential    A double real vector representing the chemical potential of each species.  To be
    !                        precise, this is defined as the difference between the standard molar Gibbs energy
    !                        and the chemical potential defined by the element potentials (represented in
    !                        dimensionless units and per formula mass).
    ! dMolesPhase           A double real vector representing the number of moles of each phase.
    ! dSumMolFractionSoln   A double real vector representing the sum of mole fractions in each solution phase.
    ! dPGEFunctionNorm      A double real scalar representing the norm of the functional vector in the PGESolver.
    ! dTolerance            A double real vector representing numerical tolerances defined in InitThermo.f90.
