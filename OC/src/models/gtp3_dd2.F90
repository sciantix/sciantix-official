! Description of data structure
!
! For all elements, species and phases there are two arrays defined.
! The first (data) array contains the elements species etc and all their data
! in the order they were entered and the data are never moved.
! The second (index) array contain the elements, species etc in alphabetical 
! (or whatever) order and is updated whenever a new element, species etc 
! is added. This array is an integer array with the index of the data array.
! Most links inside the different records to elements, species etc
! are indices to the data array which is never changed.  
! TPFUNS used in parameters are also stored in an array and the index
! to this array is stored in the property record to specify the function.
!
! For parameters inside each phase record there is one (or 2 if disordered set)
! lists with endmember parameters.  Each endmember record can be the root
! of a binary tree with interaction parameters.  Each of these records
! can have a property list with various data like G, TC, MQ etc.  These
! records are created dynamically and can only be found by following the links.
!
! Each phase has one or more composition sets.  These are part of the
! equilibrium data structure which also contains conditions,
! calculated values of TP functions and other symbols.  To identify a
! phase+comp.set a phasetuple has been intoduced.  This contains two
! integers, th first is the phase number, the second the composition
! set number.  The second or higher composition set of a phase will
! have a tupel index higher that the number of phases.
!
! One equilibrium record is created in init_gtp and it is called
! FIRSTEQ which is a global variable.  There is also an array EQLISTA
! which should contain all allocated equilibrium records, FIRSTEQ is a
! pointer to the first element in this array.  More equilibrium
! records can be initiated by the enter_equilibrium subroutine.  This
! copies the relevant data from FIRSTEQ.  After a second equilibrium
! is created it is forbidden to enter elements, species and phases and
! create additional fraction sets, i.e. one must not change the data
! structure except to add/remove composition sets (but this should
! anyway be avoided).  Composition sets must be created in all
! equilibrium records at the same time (if done in a thread then all
! threads must stop while this is done).  During step/map calculation
! each calculated equilibria is saved for later use in plotting och
! other postprocessing.  These saved equilibria may have different
! number of composition sets so great care must be taken using them.
!
! The equilibrium data record is "stand alone" and contains all necessary
! data to describe the equilibrium (except the model parameters and other
! static data).  In parallel processing each thread will have its own
! equilibrium data record.
!
! The intention is that several equilibra can be created both to store
! individual experimental data in assessments and for each thread in
! parallel.  In the equilibrium record there are conditions,
! components (with chemical potentials) and an error code and most
! important, the phase_varres record array with one or more record for
! each phase.  This array must be identical in all equilibria recods.
! Each composition set has a phase_varres record and they are linked
! from the phase record by the LIKTOCS array.  As the phase_varres
! records are in an array the link is simply an integer index of this
! array.  There is a free list (in FIRSTEQ) in the phase_varres array
! to be used when adding or removing a composition set.  The EQ_TPRES
! array is declared inside the equilibrium record for calculated
! results of the TPFUNS as these can be different in each equilibria.
! The index to a function in EQ_TPRES is the same as the index to the
! TPFUN array declared globally in TPFUN.  The TPFUN array has the
! actual expression, and EQ_TPRES has the last calculated results,
! which can be different in each equilibrium.  The TPFUN index is used
! in property records to specify the function of a parameter.
! 
! In many subroutines the equilibrium record called CEQ (Current EQilibrium)
! is an argument which means it operates on the data in that 
! equilibrium record only.
!
! In the record array PHASE_VARRES (including disordered) each phase 
! and composition set has a record.  If no parallel calculation and no
! experiments the equilibrium record FIRSTEQ is enough.
!
! In programming for parallel processing THREADPRIVATE
! should be avoided as it usually has a very slow implementation.
!
! Some routines exist both with and without the CEQ argument.  A programmer
! can create his own array of equilibrium data records and use any of
! them in such calls. ???? Maybe not, then how to update when a new
! composition set is needed???
!
! Thread specific data are needed for conditions, phase status, constitution,
! function values and calc results like G and derivatives for each phase,
! amounts of phases etc.  When calling a subroutine to get mole frations etc 
! the equilibrium record CEQ must be supplied.
!
! The global error code is defined in tpfunlib, that is not very good.  There
! must be an error code specific to each equilibrium.  Or can one declare
! the error code as "local" to the thread?
