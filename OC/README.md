This is the development version of OpenCalphad, normally updated a few times each month.

The stable version can be downloaded from http://opencalphad.org either as a zip file or as a precompiled installation for Windows.

OpenCalphad is a free thermodynamic software for calculation of multicomponent equilibria, property and phase diagrams and for database development.  It has a simple command line interface and an Application Software Interface (OCASI) for integration in simulation software. For simulations it can calculate equilibria in parallel using OpenMP.

There is a community room for questions and discussions at https://gitter.im/opencalphad/opencalphad#

A third party Graphical User Interface (GUI) of OpenCalphad (named as
OpenCalphad CAE) for Windows can be downloaded from this
