This contain the instructions to compile and run the AlNiPt example.
The OC-parallel2.pdf is a presentation of the example.

1. copy OC/libs/liboceq.a    compiled with -fopenmp   here
2. copy OC/liboceqplus.mod   compiled with -fopenmp   here
3. For Linux/Mac copy OC/getkey.o                     here
4. compile the version liboctq.F90 provided here
5. compile and link sim-alnipt as below (getkey.o needed only on Linux/Mac:
   gfortran -o sim-alnipt -fopenmp sim-alnipt.F90 liboctq.o getkey.o liboceq.a


6. Run with input file setup.dat which specifies
   databasefile, elements, gridpoints etc.

7. The diffusion simulation is for a single dimension and the model is
   very simple.  All elements have the samÃ« constant mobility which is
   used to move the elements between the gridpoints keeping the total
   amount of elements constant.

7. Output is written on ocsim.plt and can be plotted directly using GNUPLOT
   The alnipt-5000.png shows several composition profiles.
