@$ This example show the T limit of diffusionless transformation
@$ from austenite (FCC) to ferrite (FCC) depending on the
@$ alloy composition.
@$ 
@$ This transformation is important as rapidly quenched austenite
@$ can transform to martensite and various forms of eutectoid
@$ structures like perlite and bainite with high strength
