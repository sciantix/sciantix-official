@$ A pure C3H8 gas has enthalpy content -99288 J at 300 K

@$ Also set the reference state of O to be gas at current T

set ref O gas


@$ We must be careful setting gas as reference state if there are

@$ The program will automatically select the species (endmember) that

@$ Change ac(o) to a higher value meaning more oxygen

@$ Higher oxygen activity means more N(O), here 9.7968 moles

@$ NOTE ALSO DALTON's LAW is valid!!! The constituent fraction of O2 is 0.09

@$ Now graphite has a positive driving force,

@$ Calculate minimum O to avoid soot

set st ph gra=fix 0

set c n(o)=none

@$ As expected we must have at least 3 moles of O (1.5 O2) to avoid soot.

@$================================================================
@$ Now something different again
@$ Testing variable P and using V as condition

@$ Now release P as condition at same V

@$ Same equilibrium with V as condition, next change V

@$ With a bigger volume P has decreased to 94963 Pa
@$ or 0.94963 bar

set c v=1

l,,,,,

@$ With a smaller volume the pressure increases, P=1.8499 bar
@$ Check Boyles law: P1V1=P2V2 (N/m2 * m3) = Nm = J
@$ right hand side: 2*94963=189926 J
@$ left hand side:  1*184990 Pa

@$===============================================================
@$ Yet another test
@&
@$ 
@$ We can use expressions for some state variables like N(C)
@$ try that but first rearrange the other conditions

set c v=none
set c p=1e5

c e

l,,,,

@&
@$
@$ This condition means there will be a constant ratio between C and H
set c 8*n(c)-3*n(h)=0

set c n(h)=none

c e

l,,,,,

@$ The equilibrium is the same, N(H)=8/3*N(C) !
@&
@$ Now increase C

set c n(c)=4

c e

l,,,,,

@$ The amount of h has also increased to keep the ratio
@$ 3*n(c)-8*n(h)=0

@&
@$ A feature added 2019.07.22: 
@$ Setting a constituent fraction of a phase
@$
@$ We already have a fairly complicated set of conditions

l c

@&
@$ But we may for some reason prescribe the amount of H2O molecules in
@$ the gas (do not ask me why...)

set cond y(gas,h2o1)


@$ Note we have to specify H2O1 as there is a H2O2 molecule also!
@$ At first just calculate with the current value, we have to remove
@$ another condition, for example the amount of C

set c n(c)=none

l c

@&

c e

@&

l,,,,

@$ We have just recalculated the same equilibrium with another 
@$ set of external conditions.
@&
@$ But now we can increase the fraction of H2O1

set c y(gas,h2o1)
0.3

c e

@&

l,,,,


@$ The amount of both C and H has decreased to fullfull the condition
@$ that the fraction of H2O1 in the gas should be 0.3.
@&

@$ Playing with condition on the constitution of a phase can easily
@$ lead to failed calculations because it may be impossible to find
@$ an equilibrium with a specified fraction of a molecule.

set c y(gas,h2o1)=0.4

c e


@$ This fails because it is impossible to have such a high fraction of H2O1
@$ in the gas at this T
@&
@$ We can try with a smaller value

set c y(gas,h2o1)=.01

c e

@&

l,,,,


@$ This works.
@&
@$ The amounts of both C and H has increased.

@$ That is all for now !!
