@$====================================
@$ In a Scheil-Gulliver simulation the liquid is assumed to be
@$ homogeneous and in equilibrium with the most recently formed solid.
@$ The at each step in T the solid formed is removed
@$ and the liquid composition modified according to the quilibrium
@$ This means the liquid composition will vary until we reach
@$ an invariant equilibrium where the last liquid will disappear.
