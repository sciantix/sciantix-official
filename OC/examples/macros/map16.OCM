@$ Plotting this text is a bit complicated

Title Map 16 Fig 2


@$ This diagram a bit strange as we have 2 potential axis in a ternary system
@$ Along all lines there is a phase fix and and one or 2 more phases stable.
@$ The single phase and two-phase regions are areas
@$ but the 3-phase regions are also lines (the line FCC+M7C+M23C!!)
@$ The invariant equilibrium with 4 stable phases is just a point
@$ All according to Gibbs phase rule.

@$ In this diagram the invariant looks like  a road crossing.
